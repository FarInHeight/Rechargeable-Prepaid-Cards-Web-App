# Rechargeable Prepaid Cards Web App

This project is a simple web application to manage the creation, charging and recharging of prepaid cards.

There are two roles: Admins and Merchants.

Each admin can:
- Create a new card;
- Unblock or block a card;
- Create a merchant user;
- Unblock or block a merchant user;
- View all transactions.

Each merchant can:
- Add or subtract credit from a card (i.e., perform a transaction);
- View his/her transactions.

Anyone can see the credit of a specific card by its number.

## Project Specifications

The project is built using Spring Boot + Spring Security for the backend and JS + jQuery + Bootstrap for the frontend.

Server-side rendering is done using Thymeleaf.

### Notes

To try the project, the file [db-creation.sql](./db-creation.sql) allows you to create a small db containing some cards, users and transactions. 

The passwords for each user are generated by concatenating the string "password" with the user id. For example, the first user has id equal to 1, so the password is "password1", and so on.
